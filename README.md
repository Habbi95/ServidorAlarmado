# ServidorAlarmado
This is a repository for my final Master project (TFM). It consists in a java Websocket application, connected to a few Esp8266 NodeMCU nodes and collects data from temperature, humidity, light, ... sensors.  Also, the server generates a .csv file with all the data collected so you can go to Excel and do all that statistics stuff. 
Also, the server generates events to the nodes based on the received data automatically.
